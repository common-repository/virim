Analyzes social activity on your blog.

== Description ==
Virim is a social analytics plugin, that analyzes the social activity happening on your site. Using your data, Virim identifies your most active times, days, posts and words, helping you to get the most out of your content.

It works best if your site has some social activity (retweets, Facebook shares and/or comments) happening already. It's still very much in alpha, so there are probably bugs.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install Virim and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Navugate to the Virim tab in your WP dashboard
